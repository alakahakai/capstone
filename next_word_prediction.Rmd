## My App

- My App is about predicting the next word based on an input phrase
- Dataset is based on the provided SwiftKey dataset
- Algorithm is about using **pre-computed ngrams** to predict next word of a phrase
- Developed using RStudio Shiny
- Published to shinyapps.io

## UI

- User can select number of predictions using a slider input (default set to 1 per requirement)
- Some simple Help Text is provided to help users understand the usage
- A text input box is provided to input the phrase
- User input is echoed back with leading and trailing whitespaces removed, and word predictions are displayed below the text input box.

## Server

- server.R and predict.R provide the backend
- Echo the input to UI after removing whitespaces
- Load the ngram data (sorted in frequency descending order)
- The prediction algorithm works as follows:
    * If phrase has at least two words, use the last two words to search trigram; If number of results are less than requested, use the last word to search bigram; If the combined results are still less than requested, use unigram to fill up.
    * If phrase only has one word, search bigram; If the number of results is less than requested, use unigram to fill up.
    * If no input, use unigram.
- Return the results to UI.


## What I Learned

- Data cleaning is very important in text mining
- Ngram is useful in word prediction
- Shiny is a great way to develop and deploy R web applications
- Thanks for your time!
